# Nextplate 🍽️

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is **the** Next.js boilerplate I use for the most of my projects. It contains the following conventions/features:

* Fully written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) & [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
* Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
